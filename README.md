## Introduction

This solution uses an Terraform template to launch a three NIC deployment of a cloud-focused BIG-IP VE cluster (Active/Standby) in Microsoft Azure. Traffic flows from an ALB to the BIG-IP VE which then processes the traffic to application servers. This is the standard cloud design where the BIG-IP VE instance is running with a dual interface, where both management and data plane traffic is processed on each one.  

The BIG-IP VEs have the following modules enabled:
* [Local Traffic Manager (LTM)](https://f5.com/products/big-ip/local-traffic-manager-ltm) module enabled to provide advanced traffic management functionality.
* Firewall
* WAF
* Whatever

The one big thing in this Terraform accounted for is composing resources a bit differently to account for dependencies into Immutable/Mutable elements. i.e. stuff you would typically frequently change/mutate, such as traditional config on the BIG-IP. Once the template is deployed, there are certain resources (like the network infrastructure) that are fixed while others (like BIG-IP VMs and configurations) can be changed.

Ex.
-> Run once
- Deploy the entire infrastructure with all the neccessary resources, then we use Declarative Onboarding to configure the BIG-IP Cluster; AS3 to create a sample app proxy; then lastly use Service Discovery automatically add the DVWA container app to the LTM pool (Please note currently we also hardcode the node IP in the pool due to a bug in our AS3, which will be fixed in the next release)

-> Run many X
- [Redeploy BIG-IP for replacement or upgrade](#Redeploy-BIG-IP-for-replacement-or-upgrade)
- [Reconfigure BIG-IP configurations](#Rerun-AS3-on-the-big-ip-ve)

**Networking Stack Type:** This solution deploys into a new networking stack, which is created along with the solution.

## Prerequisites

- **Important**: When you configure the admin password for the BIG-IP VE in the template, you cannot use the character **#**.  Additionally, there are a number of other special characters that you should avoid using for F5 product user accounts.  See [K2873](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2873) for details.
- This template requires a service principal, one will be created in the setupAzureVars.sh.  See the [Service Principal Setup section](#service-principal-authentication) for details, including required permissions.
- This deployment will be using the Terraform Azurerm provider to build out all the neccessary Azure objects. Therefore, Azure CLI is required. for installation, please follow this [Microsoft link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-apt?view=azure-cli-latest)
- If this is the first time to deploy the F5 image, the subscription used in this deployment needs to be enabled to programatically deploy. For more information, please refer to [Configure Programatic Deployment](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/working-with-marketplace-images-on-azure-resource-manager/)
- You need to set your region and log in to azure ahead of time, the scripts will map your authenitcation credentials and create a service principle, so you will not need to hardcode any credentials in the files.
